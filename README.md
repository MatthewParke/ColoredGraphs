# ColoredGraphs
Program I made for my algorithms analysis class that checks if a graph is two-colorable.


for in-depth information on this program read the analysis which gives a description, correctness proof, runtimes, and runtime analysis.
This repository also includes some of the graph files to run the program on, called 'largegraph1' and 'smallgraph'.
